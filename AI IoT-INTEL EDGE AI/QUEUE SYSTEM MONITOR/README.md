# Smart-Queuing-System
Build custom queuing systems for the retail, manufacturing and transportation sectors and use the IntelÂ® DevCloud for the Edge to test your solutions performance.

## Main Tasks
The following pages will walk you through the steps of the project. At a high level, you will:

1. Propose a possible hardware solution
2. Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revise your proposal based on the test results
